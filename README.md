# Terraform AWS EKS Node Role Module by KWAZI

Terraform Module for Creating a Standardized IAM Role for EKS Nodes on AWS

## Getting Started

> NOTE: This section assumes that you have Terraform experience, have already created an AWS account, and have already configured programmatic access to that account via access token, Single-Sign On (SSO), or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. If you need help, [checkout our website](https://www.kwazi.io).

The simplest way to get started is to create a `main.tf` file with the minimum configuration options. You can use the following as a template:

```HCL

module "terraform_aws_role_eks_node" {
  source = "kwaziio/aws/role-eks-node"
}
```
